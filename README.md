# small-util-js
A small set of random JavaScript utils which I've found to be useful for general development.

Can merge the utils into your own object with the following line:

`SmallUtil.assignIf(myNamespaceObject, SmallUtil)`


Overview of features:
- Numeric/mathematical constants.
- Object iteration functions, replacing the need for `isOwnProperty()` loops.
- Object assignment, conditional assignment, and extension.
- Other object utilities.
- Other iteration utilities.
- Array utilities.
- String utilities.
- Fullscreen utilities.
- Window scaling utilities.
- `windowLoaded` event callback registering helper.
- An assert() function.
- A deep-copy function.
